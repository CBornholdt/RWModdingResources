# Texteditors

It doesn't matter which you use, as long as it isn't notepad.exe, Microsoft Word or Libreoffice.

Here's a list of good text editors.

- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
- [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Try them out for yourself and see which fits.

All of them have one critical feature which you will use a lot: `Folders as workspaces` and "Find in Files". Open `Core\Defs` as a workspace and it adds an explorer-type filetree to your windows. You can then search all the files inside that folder and its subfolders. Need to find all occurrences of "`<costList>`"? Find in files has you covered. This is by far the most useful feature, and it will greatly increase your efficiency.
